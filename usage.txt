Data is fed by data.json, for encrypted outputs use either "caesar" or "vigenere", for custom ciphers not supported/accomodated for use "custom".

caesar syntax in data.json:

                    "kitchen": [
                        "caesar",
                        "message to be encrypted"
                    ]

output ingame will be encrypted.

vigenere syntax in data.json:

                    "ballroom": [
                        "vigenere",
                        "message to be encrypted"
                    ]

output ingame will be encrypted.

custom syntax in data.json:

                    "hall": [
                        "custom",
                        "plaintext message",
                        "⸅⦝⅃｢⊡>□⋗> ⟄□vv⅃ꓶ□"
                    ]

For games that do not involve encryption the data.json is equally as simple:

                    "ballroom": [
                        "custom",
                        "answer to the riddle/question",
                        "question to ask on-screen"
                    ]
